# Introduction to Julia and GMT.jl 
by Christopher M. Calvelage

This notebook should teach you the basics of the Julia programming language and how to use common GMT methods with a high-level API. Resources for this tutorial can be found at: https://github.com/ccalvelage3/julia_tutorial.git

Julia in a nutshell: 

**Fast:** 
Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.

**Reproducible:**
Reproducible environments make it possible to recreate the same Julia environment every time, across platforms, with pre-built binaries.

**General:**
Julia provides asynchronous I/O, metaprogramming, debugging, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more. One can build entire Applications and Microservices in Julia.

**Dynamic:**
Julia is dynamically typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.

**Composable:**
Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. The talk on the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch explains why it works so well.

**Open source:**
Julia is an open source project with over 1,000 contributors. It is made available under the MIT license. The source code is available on GitHub.

md"## Basic Julia
Syntactically, Julia is very similar to Matlab and Python. 
"

# ╔═╡ 830a7b90-eca6-11ea-30c5-dfa9a9b4d965
md" Lets start by making some basic arrays:"

# ╔═╡ 8b42ab70-eca6-11ea-0828-a7fa1cd88119
A = [1 2; 3 4]

# ╔═╡ 91beac60-eca6-11ea-289d-1168c1c37034
md" We see from the above code that you make arrays and matrices the same way as we do in Matlab. We can also index the matrix as we do in Matlab:" 

# ╔═╡ 9ca88ec0-eca6-11ea-16e8-d5a31fb90f2f
A[1,2]

# ╔═╡ b356adf0-eca6-11ea-383b-63ceb28fdbb8
md" #### _An example with an image_
Let's look at something a little more interesting and download an image from the internet. We'll see that an image is really just a large matrix of colors."

# ╔═╡ a52abff0-eca6-11ea-3c51-abefaa6422ab
begin
	url = "https://edgy.app/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Julia-FI.jpg"
	download(url,"julia_logo.jpg")
	my_logo = load("julia_logo.jpg")
end

# ╔═╡ 0dacfec0-ecad-11ea-0694-0dcd8ba018bc
md" We've loaded an image that we downloaded from the internet. Pretty cool. Let's see wat type 'my_logo' is:"

# ╔═╡ 4a565290-ecad-11ea-0b42-5d47302b1f11
typeof(my_logo)

# ╔═╡ 6a540512-ecad-11ea-0f7e-cd5d5135e96a
md" We can see that an image is just an array of RGB colors as pixels. Because it is an array, we can index it as such. Let's check the size and try it out:"

# ╔═╡ 878f8a50-ecad-11ea-05c6-ddf8beba17fe
size(my_logo) # 2000 by 2000 pixels

# ╔═╡ a36f501e-ecad-11ea-34f4-13556d2517d2
my_logo[1000,1000]

# ╔═╡ e2e02860-ecad-11ea-0f93-d30e04519199
md" Naturally, when we index an array of colors it returns the color that lives at our index. Now what if we took a slice:"

# ╔═╡ 0c6bd6be-ecae-11ea-025f-c7bb8282d2cc
my_logo[1:1000, 1:1500]

# ╔═╡ 22f9c3c0-ecae-11ea-1f35-213150d2fc15
md" As expected, this gives us a nice slice of the image.
Just like any array we can also change the value of the image. Let's try it:"

# ╔═╡ a7a0f672-ecae-11ea-260b-7fcb27b0d0da
begin
	new_logo = copy(my_logo)
	new_logo[1:500,1:750] .= RGB(0,1,0) # Define replacement color
	new_logo
end

# ╔═╡ 31953c70-ecae-11ea-2949-719f2e374ffe
md""" Now the values have been changed to green in the interval that we specified. Let's look more closely at how we accomplished that. We used: 

"new_logo[1:500,1:750] .= RGB(0,1,0)" 

One of the coolest things that Julia brings to the table is a method called **broadcasting**, this is the **".="** operation we did during the color assignment. This method allows for the entry-wise calculation within arrays without the use of a for loop """

# ╔═╡ 80ce62b0-ecb0-11ea-30f8-cfb673dc4cc9
md" #### _Plotting data_
Here we'll make up our own data, put it into a dataframe using DataFrames.jl, and make some plots using the Plots.jl package. You can find documentation for these packages at:

http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/

https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/

Again, you can find great lists of packages for Julia at:

end

end

# ╔═╡ d17f0120-ed8b-11ea-0db5-c52b2291fef3
md" We now have a nicely formatted dataframe that we can reference with dot methods. The DataFrames.jl package acts just like the Pandas package in Python. This means that we can use df.x to outout the x column. This is very useful. 
Now lets try some plots:"

# ╔═╡ 795c08f0-ecb2-11ea-260a-af9c6346f54d
Plots.scatter(df.x,df.y)

# ╔═╡ 3f4ddcf0-ecb3-11ea-2e76-21d52f5d68ed
md" Just like Matlab, its fairly straightforward to make plots. Let's make a few more examples."

# ╔═╡ 23320310-ecb4-11ea-260c-c5b93b1a0d8c
Plots.plot(df.x, df.y)

# ╔═╡ 58848650-ecb4-11ea-0f5f-c995f6f54922
md" We can see that this didnt go very well because of the noise that we added to the original functions. Let's fix that:"

# ╔═╡ 74f604d0-ecb4-11ea-1fba-cbb420c76b5a
# remove the randomness
begin
	x2 = 0:0.1:10*pi # range from 0 to 10pi by 0.1 steps

end

# ╔═╡ d6059560-ecb4-11ea-3b4d-7faee41c27e8
Plots.plot(df2.x, df2.y)

# ╔═╡ 1b0a14f0-ecb6-11ea-00ba-a965190ef031
md" Now we have a nice smooth curve. Lets try a simple heat map. Heat maps are useful for plotting things like topography and velocity."

# ╔═╡ efd90910-ecb7-11ea-3042-97f61819dee1
begin
	xs = [string("x", i) for i = 1:10]

	heatmap(xs, ys, z, aspect_ratio = 1)
end

# ╔═╡ 2640cae2-ecce-11ea-3063-9b121f7eb99a
md" Something cool we can do specifically in the Pluto notebook environment is bind variables to sliders. Let's look at a simple example of this:" 

# ╔═╡ a080b8b0-ecce-11ea-0d07-57f9ecf32846
md"v = $(@bind v Slider(0:20, show_value=true))"

w = sin.(a .* pi*v) 

# ╔═╡ 0ebd16c2-eccf-11ea-2a5d-d1d0aa8f3170
Plots.plot(a,w)

# ╔═╡ cadd925e-ecd1-11ea-3a6b-bbfe0ec63bfe
md" Play with the slider to see the function change in real time. This is all made possible by the reactivity of the Pluto notebook. This also means that we have to be careful when we name variables. **Variables in different cells can never be named the same thing.**"

# ╔═╡ ed977d80-ecb7-11ea-392b-470697909b9d

_frame_ represents the boundaries of the plot that we want included. Here, we specify that the annotations be created automatically and tht we only want the West and South boundaries annotated  

_color_ is where we specify the cpt we want to use for the plot

_colorbar_ is where we configure the appearance of the map adjacent colorbar. We specify that we want to use our generated cpt, the position of the bar, and the annotations associated with it.

_title_ is where we set the plot title.

_show_ = true means that we want the figure to pop-up when its done.

and _fmt_ is where we set the output of the plot. In this case it is set to jpeg.
